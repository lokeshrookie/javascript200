9. What are variables? difference between var, let, and const?

    variables are used to store data. (ex: var count = 10;)

    function scope: var
    block scope: let, const

10. What are data typs in JS?
    
    Primitives (single values, immutable(new addressed will be referenced after changing value.))
    let age = 25;          => Number
    let message = 'Hello'; => String
    let isTrue = true; => Boolean
    let x;              => undefined
    let y = null        => null

    Non-Primitives(Complex data types) (multiple values,  Mutable)
    Object
    Array
    function
    Date
    RegExp

11. difference between empty, null and undefined?

    empty: valid variable, datatype is there, value is also there.but empty or 0.
    null: valid variable, but no data type.
    undefined: value is not assigned to the variale/ variable is incomplete.

12. what is "typeof" operator?

    typeof operator is used to determine the type of each variable.
    
    realtimeuse: typeof operator used to validate the data received from the external source

    ex: var name = "lokesh"
        console.log(typeof name); // output: String.

13. What is type coersion in JS?

    Type coersion means automatic coversion of values from one type to another, during
    certain operations or comparisons.

    Realtime usecases: 
    1. During String and Number Concatenation
        let string = "42", number = 42, let boolean = true;
        ex: console.log(string + Number) // output: 4242

        console.log(number + boolean) // output: 43  // 43 + 1 (since, true is coherted as 1)

    2. While using comparison operators
        ex: console.log(number == string) // output: true ("42" is coerted to 42).
