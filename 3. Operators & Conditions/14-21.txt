14. What are operators? What are the types of opeartors in js?

    Bodmas= Brackets, Order, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction.

   
15. What is the difference between unary, binary, and ternary operators?

     Unary: operation perfomed on single operator.
        ex: a++, a--, etc.

    Binary: operation is perfomed on two operands.
        ex: a + b, a-b.

    Ternary: operation is performed on three operands.
            let marks = 80;
        ex: let result = markes>80 ? 'Pass' : 'Fail'.


16. What is short-circuit evaluation in Js?

    Short-circuit evaluation stops the execution as soon as the result can be 
    determined without the remaining sub-expressin.

    getData = () => 0;
    showError = () => 5;
    let result = getData() || showError();
    console.log(result); // If getData() returns a falsy value, call showError()


17. What is operator precedence?

        Bodmas= Brackets, Order, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction.



18. what ar the types of conditional statements in Js?

    if/else
    ternary
    switch:
        ex: 
            let a = 5;
            switch(a){
                case 2: 
                    console.log("two");
                    break;
                case 5: 
                    console.log("five");
                    break;
                default:
                    console.log("0");
            }
                



19. When to use which type of conditional statements in real applications?

20. What is the difference between == and ===?

    Loose Equality(==): compares two values for Equality after performing type coercion
    ==: used to compare two values (type coersion exist)

    Strict Equality(===): compares two values for equality without performing type coercion.    
    ===: used to compare value and type of two vairables.

21. What is the difference between Spread and Rest operator?

    Spread(...) is used to expand or spread elements from an iterable(such as an array,
    string or object) into individual elements.
    
    ex: const array = [1,2,3];
    console.log(...array); // output: 1,2,3

    There are three mains applications of Spread operator:
    1. Copying an Array: 
        const originalArray = [1,2,3];
        const copiedArray = [...originalArray];
        console.log(copiedArray);
    2. Merging arrays
        const array1 = [1,2,3];
        const array2 = [4,5];
        const mergedArray = [...array1, ...array2];
        console.log(a+b+c+d+e); // output: [1,2,3,4,5]
    3.  Passing Multiple Arguments to Function:
        const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
        sum(...numbers);
        funciton sum(a, b, c, d, e){
            console.log(a + b + c + d + e); // output: 15
        }

    Rest operator: used in funciton parameters to collect all remaining
        Arguments into an array.

        ex: 
            display(1,2,3,4,5);

            funciton display(first, second, ...remaining){
                console.log(first);
                console.log(second);

                console.log(remaining); // output: [3,4,5];
            }
